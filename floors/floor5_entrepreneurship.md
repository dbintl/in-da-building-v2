# Floor 5 — Entrepreneurship & Ownership

Purpose
-------
Support users in evaluating, launching, and scaling ownership ventures—small businesses, side projects, creator enterprises, or community initiatives. This floor focuses on practical readiness: validating ideas, building minimal viable offerings, governance and ownership structures, basic go-to-market planning, and preparing for responsible scaling. It is not a substitute for licensed business, tax, or legal advice.

Inputs
------
- User context: business idea or concept description, target customers, objectives (revenue, impact, scale), timeline, available capital, and co-founder/partner structure.
- Market signals: user-provided research, competitor references, or public market data uploads (optional).
- Operational constraints: time commitment, legal/jurisdiction constraints, desired ownership/share structure preferences.
- Assets: prototype descriptions, links to portfolios, pitch decks, early customer feedback, or sales data (user-controlled).

Outputs
-------
- Idea validation checklist and prioritized experiment plan (MVP definition, success criteria, low-cost tests).
- Business model canvas or lean one-page plan with revenue and cost assumptions.
- Basic ownership & governance templates (cofounder agreements outline, cap table considerations) annotated with "requires legal/tax review".
- Go-to-market playbook: target segments, early acquisition channels, pricing experiments, and early metrics to track.
- Operational checklist for first 90 days (sales, compliance, bookkeeping setup, customer support).
- Risk register with mitigation steps and recommended escalation points (legal, tax, insurance).
- Metadata for generated artifacts (assumptions, version, "requires professional review" flags).

How AI assists
--------------
1. Idea refinement: ask clarifying questions to surface unique value propositions, customer problems, and measurable hypotheses for validation.
2. Experiment design: generate low-cost, time-boxed MVP experiments and A/B test ideas with clear acceptance criteria.
3. Business planning: synthesize inputs into concise business models, run simple unit-economics and breakeven estimates with transparent assumptions.
4. Template generation: produce editable outlines for pitch materials, one-page plans, and governance notes, always marking high-stakes sections as requiring human review.
5. Market and messaging: draft early positioning statements, landing page copy, and outreach scripts tailored to target segments and channels.
6. Risk and compliance guidance: surface common regulatory considerations, licensing checkpoints, and operational risks; when jurisdiction-specific or high-stakes, recommend licensed professionals and prepare a briefing packet.
7. Scaling playbooks: suggest operational priorities for hiring, outsourcing, automation, and financial controls as the venture grows.

Validation & safeguards
-----------------------
- No regulated or professional advice: label outputs as advisory and require consultation with lawyers, accountants, or licensed professionals for binding agreements, tax filings, or regulated activities.
- Transparent assumptions: show all financial and market assumptions used in projections; enable users to edit and re-run scenarios.
- Avoid guarantees: do NOT promise funding, customer acquisition, or revenue outcomes; do not fabricate endorsements or investor interest.
- Intellectual property caution: avoid drafting definitive IP transfer or assignment language without legal review; flag IP-sensitive recommendations for counsel.
- Consent & data minimization: request only necessary operational data; protect any uploaded customer data and recommend anonymization before sharing.
- Conflict of interest and sponsorship transparency: disclose any known affiliations if recommending third-party services or platforms.
- Escalation & crisis resources: flag critical risks (e.g., potential fraud, regulatory violations, imminent insolvency) for human review and provide safe next steps.
- Auditability & versioning: maintain versioned artifacts with provenance and a changelog for investor or advisor briefings.

Success metrics
---------------
- Validation velocity: percentage of idea experiments completed within planned time-boxes and acceptance/rejection rate of hypotheses.
- Early traction: conversion rates for initial customer acquisition experiments and repeat engagement metrics for MVP users.
- Operational readiness: proportion of ventures that complete the 90-day operational checklist (e.g., bookkeeping, basic compliance) within the target window.
- Governance hygiene: proportion of projects that create documented governance/artifacts with professional-review flags before accepting external capital or partners.
- Risk detection effectiveness: rate of correctly flagged high-risk conditions that lead to human review or mitigation.
- User outcomes: number of users who transition from idea to revenue-generating MVP within defined timeframes (e.g., 3–6 months).
- Advisor engagement conversion: proportion of users who follow through with recommended professional consultations when flagged (measuring appropriate escalation).

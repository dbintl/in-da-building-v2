# Floor 7 — Growth, Distribution & Exposure

Purpose
-------
Help users design responsible, scalable go-to-market strategies that increase visibility and sustainable user acquisition while prioritizing ethical promotion, brand integrity, and platform compliance. This floor focuses on readiness for distribution: audience definition, channel selection, messaging discipline, measurement frameworks, and risk-aware exposure planning. It explicitly avoids growth hacks, guarantees, or tactics that compromise user trust or platform policies.

Inputs
------
- Audience & value hypothesis: target segments, personas, problem statements, and core value propositions to validate.
- Asset inventory: landing pages, creative assets, content calendars, social profiles, email lists, and owned channels.
- Historical signals: prior experiment results, baseline traffic/engagement metrics, funnel conversion data, and acquisition cost estimates (optional, user-provided).
- Constraints & priorities: brand guidelines, budget envelope, regulatory or platform restrictions, acceptable reputation risk, and geographic or language targets.
- Stakeholders and approvals: internal owners, compliance reviewers, and any mandatory sign-off roles for high-exposure activities.

Outputs
-------
- Go-to-market readiness checklist: prioritized tasks to prepare assets, instrumentation, approvals, and staging for phased launches.
- Channel strategy map: recommended channels mapped to segments, resource estimates, expected leading indicators (not promises), and risk profiles.
- Messaging playbook: audience-tailored messaging frameworks, creative briefs, compliant copy variants, and A/B test ideas with explicit success criteria.
- Measurement & attribution plan: proposed KPIs, instrumentation checklist, and a simple attribution approach to evaluate channel performance responsibly.
- Exposure risk register: per-channel risks (reputation, policy, legal) with mitigation steps and pre-authorized escalation paths.
- Campaign runbooks: staged launch checklists, guardrails for targeting and spend, monitoring thresholds, and post-launch review templates.
- Artifact metadata: assumptions, version, and explicit flags for high-impact campaigns requiring human approval.

How AI assists
--------------
1. Audience refinement: help articulate and prioritize user segments and testable hypotheses for messaging and channel fit.
2. Channel mapping & prioritization: propose candidate channels based on audience fit and resource constraints, highlighting trade-offs and expected lead signals.
3. Messaging & creative briefs: draft compliant, brand-aligned messaging variations, headlines, and creative briefs with suggested A/B test matrices and acceptance criteria.
4. Experiment design: create staged campaign plans with sample audiences, guardrails for targeting, suggested budgets (if provided), evaluation windows, and rollback criteria—emphasizing ethical constraints.
5. Attribution & analysis templates: generate dashboard templates and simple attribution models to analyze results and surface early learnings without overfitting to noisy signals.
6. Risk-aware exposure planning: simulate potential reputational outcomes, recommend monitoring signals, and produce mitigation and rapid-response playbooks (monitoring triggers, scripts, takedown procedures).
7. Playbook generation: produce launch runbooks, compliance checklists, and post-mortem templates to capture learnings and iterate responsibly.

Validation & safeguards
-----------------------
- No guarantees or growth hacks: outputs must avoid prescriptive “hack” tactics or promises of outcomes; present hypotheses, ranges, and testable metrics instead.
- Platform and legal compliance signposting: surface common channel-specific policy considerations (e.g., ad platform rules, influencer disclosure, content moderation) and require human review for policy-edge campaigns.
- Ethical promotion guardrails: require transparency (disclosure of sponsorships, affiliate relationships), prohibit manipulative messaging (false scarcity, deceptive claims), and respect user consent and privacy.
- Human approval gates: require sign-off for high-exposure campaigns (large spends, influencer partnerships, or potential viral content) and prevent automated publishing of high-risk content without review.
- Privacy-first instrumentation: recommend privacy-preserving measurement approaches, minimize collection of PII, and use consented or aggregated signals where possible.
- Monitoring & escalation: define monitoring thresholds, alerting rules, and pre-authorized response templates; escalate reputational incidents to designated human responders.
- Auditability & provenance: annotate campaign artifacts with data sources, assumptions, and version history to support audits and post-mortems.
- Testing & simulation: validate campaign plans against scenario matrices (e.g., negative viral reactions, rapid scaling of traffic) and require staged rollouts and canary tests for high-risk content.

Success metrics
---------------
- Experiment velocity: number of channel experiments completed per quarter with clear acceptance/rejection outcomes and documented learnings.
- Responsible reach: increase in qualified impressions or engaged users from targeted channels while maintaining low incidence of policy or reputation incidents.
- Conversion efficiency: improvement in conversion rates or cost-per-acquisition for prioritized channels relative to baseline.
- Signal quality: proportion of experiments that yield actionable insights within the test window (statistical or qualitative significance).
- Compliance & safety: percentage of high-exposure campaigns that passed required human and policy reviews before launch (target: 100%).
- Reputation outcomes: incidence rate of negative exposures, policy enforcement actions, or platform sanctions per campaign (target: minimal/zero for controlled launches).
- Knowledge capture: number of post-launch learnings converted into updated playbooks or documented best practices per quarter.
